                    <h2>About TESS</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is the next step in the search for planets outside of our solar system,
                    including those that could support life. The mission will find exoplanets that periodically block part of the light from
                    their host stars, events called transits. TESS will survey 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun to search for
                    transiting exoplanets. TESS launched on April 18, 2018, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
                    
                    TESS scientists expect the mission will catalog thousands of planet candidates and vastly increase the current number of
                    known exoplanets. Of these, approximately 300 are expected to be Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized exoplanets, which are
                    worlds no larger than twice the size of Earth. TESS will find the most promising exoplanets orbiting our nearest and
                    brightest stars, giving future researchers a rich set of new targets for more comprehensive follow-up studies.</p>

                    <h4>Mission Approach</h4>
                    
                    <p>TESS will survey the entire sky over the course of two years by breaking it up into 26 different sectors, each 24
                    degrees by 96 degrees across. The powerful cameras on the spacecraft will stare at each sector for at least 27 days,
                    looking at the brightest stars at a two-minute cadence. From Earth, the moon occupies half a degree, which is less than
                    1/9,000th the size of the TESS tiles.
                    
                    The stars TESS will study are 30 to 100 times brighter than those the Kepler mission and K2 follow-up surveyed, which
                    will enable far easier follow-up observations with both ground-based and space-based telescopes. TESS will also cover a
                    sky area 400 times larger than that monitored by Kepler.
                    
                    In addition to its search for exoplanets, TESS will allow scientists from the wider community to request targets for
                    astrophysics research on approximately 20,000 additional objects during the mission through its Guest Investigator
                    program.</p>

                <h2>How TESS Finds Exoplanets</h2>
                <p>Raw data from TESS is processed by a supercomputer at NASA Ames and turned into a measure of the brightness of a star. These brightness measurements can be lined up into a time series called a light curve. The light curves of stars are inspected for dips in brightness that could mean a planet is passing in front of the star, however these dips could also indicate many other types of cosmic activity. The following light curve is of the star TIC 25155310, which is confirmed to host the planet WASP-126 b.</p>
